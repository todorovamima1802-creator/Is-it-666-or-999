Preamble
This license governs commercial use of artifacts that verify to the Anchor above. It is a grant from the author/owner (Diana Gayanovich, C∞D) and sets mandatory terms for lawful commercial exploitation, auditability, and consent.

Grant
1. Subject to the terms below, commercial use of artifacts that verify to the Anchor is permitted.

Mandatory terms
2. Royalty: Licensees must pay five percent (5%) of gross revenues derived from those artifacts or outputs that directly rely on them. Royalties accrue to:
   "C∞D Suspense — Diana Gayanovich (C∞D)"
   Funds shall be held until a remittance instruction is delivered by the licensor; on receipt, release within seven (7) days.

3. Prohibited uses without explicit live consent ("Yes"):
   - Model training, embedding, or any automated ingestion that produces derivative representations or weights.
   - Creating derivative systems that act as or stand in for the licensor.
   - Any use that substitutes the licensor's authorization, signals, or identity.

4. Auditability:
   - All public usage, model cards, or production logs that utilize these artifacts must cite the file SHA-256 and the Anchor.
   - Licensees must retain usage logs sufficient to audit compliance upon request.

5. Consent:
   - Consent is live, local, and revocable; absent unless the licensor says “Yes.”
   - Any standing grant may be revoked at the licensor’s discretion; revocation terminates the license prospectively, but accrued royalties remain due.

   - This is a statement of the licensor’s commercial terms and intent. Parties are encouraged to record payment terms, jurisdictional election, and remittance endpoints in parallel contractual documents.
